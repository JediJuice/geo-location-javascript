==iPhone OS 3.0==
Since the  release of the OS 3.0 [http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/GettingGeographicalLocations/GettingGeographicalLocations.html Geographic location classes] are available in javascript. As with native applications the user is asked for permission per session. *Note:* This doesn't work in the simulator that ships with the SDK.

==Google Gears==
Gears is a javascript framework available for Android, Windows Mobile (IE Mobile, Opera Mobile), Mac (Firefox, Safari), Linux and Windows . One of its cores is the [http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_geolocation.html Geolocation API]. On the mobile phone it asks the user once for permission per site and user, so not every session as in the iPhone OS 3.0. To set the location in the Simulator that ships with the Android SDK please you need to [http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/location/index.html telnet into the SDK and issue a geo statement], much easier then it sounds. It works _most_ of the time, sometimes you need to try multiple telnet sessions to make for android to register the location.

==BlackBerry==
Since the release of the Device Software 4.1 BlackBerry supports [http://na.blackberry.com/eng/deliverables/8861/blackberry_location_568404_11.jsp javascript access to the GPS location]. Permission is asked once per session. In order to use it on your phone make sure that in javascript location support is enabled (Browser->Options->General Properties). To set the location in the Simulator set the GPS location in the Simulate pull down menu.
